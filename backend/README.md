### Backyard Gardens

## About

This is the backend repository of my module 5 assignment for the coding boot camp Flatiron.
This project was built using React and Ruby on Rails. In this repository lives the backend Ruby on Rails app and a sqlite database.
Backyard Gardens is a place for gardeners to track their garden's progress year over year and communicate with other gardeners. By keeping track of the crops you grow, how high they grow and how much result they yield, users can plan for next year with insight from real data. The application also integrates with a farming API to select what crops you are growing, as well as OpenWeatherAPI to monitor the weather in your area.

## Starting the Application

To run this application locally, first install the necessary dependencies from `Gemfile`.
`bundle install`
Next, run the server at port :3000.
`rails s`
To view the application in your browser, you must login with an existing account, or create a new one on the frontend. To do this, look in the `frontend/README.md` file for instructions on starting the frontend React app.
